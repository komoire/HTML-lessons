<!-- It's possible to include one HTML element inside another. 
 This is also true for <p> tags. -->
<!-- Keep note of which elements are inline-level and which are block-level. 
 It will be important later when we learn CSS. -->
    <p>
        We can use other tags like <strong>the strong tag to emphasize text</strong>
        </p>
